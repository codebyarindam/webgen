Here's a simple PHP representation of the given data. This example uses an array to store the module details.

```php
<?php

// Define the module details
$moduleDetails = [
    'id' => 31,
    'name' => 'Index Page',
    'description' => 'Display a list of existing groups.
Provide options to:
Create a new group.
Select an existing group to view/edit contacts.',
    'order' => 1,
    'created_at' => '2025-02-05 09:17:38',
];

// Optionally, you can create a class to represent the module
class Module {
    public $id;
    public $name;
    public $description;
    public $order;
    public $created_at;

    function __construct($data) {
        $this->id = $data['id'];
        $this->name = $data['name'];
        $this->description = $data['description'];
        $this->order = $data['order'];
        $this->created_at = $data['created_at'];
    }
}

// Create a new Module instance
$module = new Module($moduleDetails);

// Print the module details
print_r($moduleDetails);
echo "\n";
print_r($module);

?>
```

Note that PHP does not have a built-in `datetime` object like Python, so we'll represent the date as a string. If you need to work with dates and times, consider using the `DateTime` class from PHP. 

In a real-world application, you would likely use a database to store module details and retrieve them as needed. The above example is simplified and for illustration purposes only. 

Example Output:

```php
Array
(
    [id] => 31
    [name] => Index Page
    [description] => Display a list of existing groups.
Provide options to:
Create a new group.
Select an existing group to view/edit contacts.
    [order] => 1
    [created_at] => 2025-02-05 09:17:38
)

Module Object
(
    [id] => 31
    [name] => Index Page
    [description] => Display a list of existing groups.
Provide options to:
Create a new group.
Select an existing group to view/edit contacts.
    [order] => 1
    [created_at] => 2025-02-05 09:17:38
)
```
